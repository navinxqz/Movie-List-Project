<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

I did the project based on **basic concepts of oop**, like Interface, Inheritance, Encapsulation, class, object, enum, abstruct, List & collection handling. It runs in a **CLI environment** where users interact with the application by typing commands and viewing text-based output. The system includes functionalities to list, add, update, delete, and view detailed information about series. The project is designed with an abstract class, interface, and CRUD operations.

### Pre-requisites
- .Net 8.0 SDK [I used v8.0.205]
- Vs Studio or any other C# compatible IDE [I used VsCode]
